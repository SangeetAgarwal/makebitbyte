## Introduction

Storing access tokens in the browser was never a good idea. Unfortunately, implicit flow is based on storing access token
in the browser. That is the reason imlicit flow is [not recommended](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/implicit/#:~:text=It%20is%20not%20recommended%20to,been%20received%20by%20the%20client) anymore.
In this flow the access token is returned as part of the url and access token in urls is extremely leaky, they end up in

1. browser history
2. log files
3. Reverse proxies
4. Browser extensions
5. Referrer headers, so say you access a cdn and the cdn via the [referer http request header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer) can acquire the access token.

Shown below is a schematic of the implicit flow.
![Implicit flow](/static/images/bff/implicit_flow.drawio.png)

To prevent access tokens from being returned in the url, the authorization code flow was used where the client app receives an
auth code and then exchanges it for an access token.
Shown below is the schematic of the authorization code flow.
![Auth Code flow](/static/images/bff/auth_code_flow.drawio.png)

The problem of storing and managing access tokens in the browser will still remain though. Code injections attacks allow for
exfilteration of storage contents. Injection attacks is top ten in the OWASP top ten list ^[See the [OWASP top ten list](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)]

In addition, browser vendors have been debating phasing out 3rd party cookies for some time now. It seems theyâ€™ve
finally decided to bite the bullet per this article from [developer chrome site](https://developer.chrome.com/en/docs/privacy-sandbox/third-party-cookie-phase-out/#:~:text=In%20Chrome%20version%20115%20or,-party-cookie-phaseout%20).
This would break any application that uses the imlicit flow.

In implicit flow the client app recieves the access token and then via the silent renew mechanism calls the IDP from an `iframe`
to return a new token passing the cookie in the header. But now with 3rd party cookie disallowed, the `iframe` will not have
access to this cookie anymore. So, essentially, the client is not able to maintain a session with the server and the server says
"hey, client, you aren't even logged in". ^[Check out the [Securing SPAs and Blazor Applications using the BFF (Backend for Frontend) Pattern - Dominick Baier](https://youtu.be/xzRhabmlc8M?t=1746)]

## Using BFF architecture to solve the problem

BFF architecture introduces an intermediary layer that runs on the server and since it runs on the server it can
manage tokens encrypted in `HttpOnly` cookies. The client app which now runs on the browser is absolved of all the
responsibility of managing tokens. The client app via a reverse proxy simply proxies over any API calls to the intermediary
layer and the intermediary layer can access the tokens stored in the `HttpOnly` cookie and make any calls to the external API
sending the access tokens in the header or these calls can be to the local API within the intermediary layer itself and here
too the access token will be sent in the header.

Shown below is the schematic of the BFF architecture.
![BFF flow](/static/images/bff/bff_flow.drawio.png)

## Creating the _backend_ part of the backend for frontend (BFF)

![backend of bff](/static/images/bff/backendofbff.png)

The entire source code is available [here](https://github.com/SangeetAgarwal/SecuringAppsWithOAuth2AndOIDC/tree/main/ReactClientAppBFF)

But, I'll walk through the specific pieces we added so it is easy to see the additions we made.

Start by adding the `Duende.BFF` nuget package ^[See the [license terms](https://duendesoftware.com/license)] to a [fresh dot net core web api project](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=visual-studio)

First you have to register the BFF services with the DI container and add services required for YARP http forwarding.

```csharp
builder.Services.AddBff()
    .AddRemoteApis();

```

Next, just as we would do with any other server side client that requires authentication, you'll add the `AddAuthentication` to register the
services required for authentication. Optionally, we can explicitly specify the cookie scheme where the access token will be stored.
Finally, we must register the `AddOpenIdConnect` handler to handle the authentication.

```csharp
builder.Services.AddAuthentication(options =>
{
    options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultChallengeScheme = "oidc";
    options.DefaultSignOutScheme = "oidc";

})
.AddCookie(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, options =>
{
    options.Cookie.Name = "__ReactSPA";
})
.AddOpenIdConnect("oidc", options =>
{
    options.Authority = identityServerConfiguration.BaseUrl.ToLower();

    options.ClientId = clientConfiguration.ClientId;
    options.ClientSecret = clientConfiguration.ClientSecret;
    options.ResponseType = "code";

    options.Scope.Add("roles");
    options.Scope.Add("subscriberSince");
    options.Scope.Add("notesapi.write");
    options.Scope.Add("notesapi.read");
    options.Scope.Add("notesapi.fullaccess");

    options.ClaimActions.Remove("aud");
    options.ClaimActions.DeleteClaim("sid");
    options.ClaimActions.DeleteClaim("idp");

    options.ClaimActions.MapJsonKey("role", "role");
    options.ClaimActions.MapJsonKey("subscriberSince", "subscriberSince");

    options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
    {
        RoleClaimType = "role",
        NameClaimType = "given_name"
    };
    options.SaveTokens = true;
    options.GetClaimsFromUserInfoEndpoint = true;
});
```

Next, we'll add the bff middleware by calling `UseBff`.

`MapBffManagementEndpoints` adds support for login, logout and logout notifications.

`AsBffApiEndpoint` adds support for local APIs. This includes anti-forgery
protection as well as suppressing login redirects on authentication failures and
instead returning `401` and `403` status codes under the appropriate circumstances.

Finally, `MapRemoteBffApiEndpoint` proxies any local calls to the actual remote api passing the access token.

```csharp
app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseBff();
app.UseAuthorization();

app.MapControllers().AsBffApiEndpoint();

app.MapBffManagementEndpoints();

app.MapRemoteBffApiEndpoint(
        "/api/notes", "https://localhost:7094/api/Note/GetNotes")
    .RequireAccessToken(TokenType.User);

```

Let's now test to see if we have configured everything properly.
Set the startup projects as `MakeBitByte.IDP` and `ReactClientAppBFF` and run the solution.

Once `ReactClientAppBFF` starts up, call the `https://localhost:7249/bff/login` endpoint. This should redirect you to the
`MakeBitByte.IDP` login page. And once you login using say `app` with password `P@ssw0rd` you should get redirected back
the index page.

If you open your developer tools and look at the cookies you should see the `__ReactSPA` cookie.

![bff cookie](/static/images/bff/spacookie.png)

If you attempt to access the `https://localhost:7249/bff/user` endpoint then you'll get an `401` error. If you look
at the logs then you'll see the following error.

```bash
fail: Duende.Bff.Endpoints.BffMiddleware[1]
      Anti-forgery validation failed. local path: '/bff/user'
```

The bff middleware adds anti-forgery protection to all calls and since we didn't add the anti-forgery teken `"X-CSRF": '1'`
to the header we get this error.

## Notes API with authorization

![remote api](/static/images/bff/remoteapi.png)

This is just a regular dot net core web api project whos endpoints are behind an IDP. In other words these require
an `access token`.

The source code for this api is available [here](https://github.com/SangeetAgarwal/SecuringAppsWithOAuth2AndOIDC/blob/main/Notes.API/Controllers/NoteController.cs)
It requires an `access token` issued by the [MakeBitByte.IDP](https://github.com/SangeetAgarwal/SecuringAppsWithOAuth2AndOIDC/tree/main/MakeBitByte.IDP).

## React client app

![frontend of bff](/static/images/bff/frontendofbff.png)
Finally, we'll add the _frontend_ for the backend for frontend (BFF). This now is the react client app.

The source code for this app is available [here](https://github.com/SangeetAgarwal/SecuringAppsWithOAuth2AndOIDC/tree/main/ReactClientApp).

I created the app with [vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) using the following command.

```bash
npm create vite@latest reactclientappbff -- --template react-ts
```

Then I added [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to the app using [this guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite).

I added [react query](https://tanstack.com/query/v3/) as well as axios to the app.

```bash
npm install react-query axios
```

update the `main.tsx` to look like so

```tsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App.tsx";
import "./index.css";
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "react-query";
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";

// Create a client
const queryClient = new QueryClient();

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    {/* Provide the client to your App  */}
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <BrowserRouter>
        <App />
      </BrowserRouter>
    </QueryClientProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

Wrapping the `App` component with `QueryClientProvider` makes the `queryClient` available to all the components in the app.

We'll now create a custom `useAuthUser` hook. Within this hook we'll use the `useQuery` hook from `react-query` to fetch
the claims from the `/bff/user` endpoint.

So, our custom `useAuthUser` hook will look like so, if you need a quick refresher on what custom hooks are or how to
create them then check out [this article](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks).

```tsx
import axios from "axios";
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { useQuery } from "react-query";

interface AuthUser {
  given_name: string | undefined;
  family_name: string | undefined;
  email: string;
  sub: string;
  roles: string[];
  bffLogoutUrl: string;
}

const config = {
  headers: {
    "X-CSRF": "1",
  },
};

export const fetchClaims = async () => {
  const response = await axios.get("/bff/user", config);
  return response.data;
};

function useClaims() {
  const { isLoading, error, data } = useQuery("claims", fetchClaims, {
    retry: false,
  });
  return { isLoading, error, data };
}

export function useAuthUser() {
  const { isLoading, error, data } = useClaims();
  const claims = data as [{ type: string; value: string }];

  const [user, setUser] = useState<AuthUser | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (claims) {
      const given_name =
        claims.find((c) => c.type === "given_name")?.value ?? "";
      const family_name =
        claims.find((c) => c.type === "family_name")?.value ?? "";
      const email = claims.find((c) => c.type === "email")?.value ?? "";
      const sub = claims.find((c) => c.type === "sub")?.value ?? "";
      const roles = claims.filter((c) => c.type === "role").map((c) => c.value);
      const bffLogoutUrl =
        claims.find((c) => c.type === "bff:logout_url")?.value ?? "";
      setUser({ given_name, family_name, email, sub, roles, bffLogoutUrl });
    }
  }, [claims]);
  return { isLoading, error, claims, user };
}
```

But, where would this `/bff/user` endpoint be? Remember, we added the `MapBffManagementEndpoints` middleware in the `Configure` method
of the `Startup` class in the `ReactClientAppBFF` project. This middleware adds support for login, logout and logout notifications.
So, the `/bff/user` endpoint is added by this middleware. And since we set the `returnUrl` to `"/"` in `/bff/login?returnUrl=/` we
get routed back to the index page of our react app.

Next question would be how do we get to this `/bff/user` endpoint? We are routing to this endpoint as if this exists in our local app when in fact
it exists in the `ReactClientAppBFF` project. This is where the reverse proxy comes in. We'll add a reverse proxy to the `vite.config.ts`.

So, now all calls to `/bff/user` will be routed to `https://localhost:7249/bff/user`.

```ts {9,10}
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react-swc";
import basicSsl from "@vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl";
// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), basicSsl()],
  server: {
    proxy: {
      "/bff": {
        target: "https://localhost:7249",
        secure: false,
        configure: (proxy, _options) => {
          proxy.on("error", (err, _req, _res) => {
            console.log("proxy error", err);
          });
          proxy.on("proxyReq", (proxyReq, req, _res) => {
            console.log("Sending Request to the Target:", req.method, req.url);
          });
          proxy.on("proxyRes", (proxyRes, req, _res) => {
            console.log(
              "Received Response from the Target:",
              proxyRes.statusCode,
              req.url
            );
          });
        },
      },
      "/signin-oidc": {
        target: "https://localhost:7249",
        secure: false,
      },
      "/signout-callback-oidc": {
        target: "https://localhost:7249",
        secure: false,
      },
      "/api/notes": {
        target: "https://localhost:7249",
        secure: false,
        configure: (proxy, _options) => {
          proxy.on("error", (err, _req, _res) => {
            console.log("proxy error", err);
          });
          proxy.on("proxyReq", (proxyReq, req, _res) => {
            console.log("Sending Request to the Target:", req.method, req.url);
          });
          proxy.on("proxyRes", (proxyRes, req, _res) => {
            console.log(
              "Received Response from the Target:",
              proxyRes.statusCode,
              req.url
            );
          });
        },
      },
      "/local/identity": {
        target: "https://localhost:7249",
        secure: false,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

All calls to the `/bff/user` endpoint will have the `HttpOnly` cookie attached to the request and the `bff` middleware in the
`ReactClientAppBFF` project will be able to extract the access token from the cookie and make the call to the IDP to get the claims.

We get this `httpOnly` cookie in our browser from the login procedure as follows. Once we call
`/bff/login` endpoint we get redirected to the IDP's login page. When the user is sent to the IDP's login page, the `redirect_uri` is set to `/signin-oidc` on the origin of the
react app since the react app initiates the login process, so this then translates to `https://localhost:5173/signin-oidc`.

In the `vite.config.ts` where we set the proxy you'll see that `/signin-oidc` is proxied to `https://localhost:7249/signin-oidc`.

```ts
  "/signin-oidc": {
    target: "https://localhost:7249",
    secure: false,
  },
```

`https://localhost:7249/signin-oidc` is a virtual endpoint on our `ReactClientAppBFF` project. Once the user has successfully
logged in, they'll be returned to this endpoint with the tokens from the IDP. And, this where the `bff`
middleware will wrap this access token in a `HttpOnly` cookie and set the `HttpOnly` cookie on the response. And we get routed back to the index page of our react app.

This is the reason why we must add these two endpoints to the list of allowed uris in the `RedirectUris` in the
`client` configuration in the IDP's `Config.cs` file.

```csharp
RedirectUris =
{
   "https://localhost:7249/signin-oidc",
   "https://localhost:5173/signin-oidc"
}
```

Alright, now that we have the `HttpOnly` cookie, we are free to make calls to other endpoints such as `/api/notes` which
is proxied to `https://localhost:7249/api/notes`.
Again, take a look at the `vite.config.ts` file where we set the proxy.

```ts
 "/api/notes": {
   target: "https://localhost:7249",
   secure: false,
 }
```

Remember, this call will have the cookie set in the header.
If you remember, our `ReactClientAppBFF` project has the following in the `Program.cs` file

```csharp
app.MapRemoteBffApiEndpoint(
        "/api/notes", "https://localhost:7094/api/Note/GetNotes")
    .RequireAccessToken(TokenType.User);
```

This means that any calls to `/api/notes` on the `ReactClientAppBFF` project which translates to `https://localhost:7249/api/notes`
will now be further proxied over to `https://localhost:7094/api/Note/GetNotes` and the access token which is extracted from the `HttpOnly` cookie
will be sent in the header.

And the resultant json response will be returned to the react app which is encapsulated in the custom hook `useNotes` shown below.

```ts
import axios from "axios";
import { useQuery } from "react-query";

const config = {
  headers: {
    "X-CSRF": "1",
  },
};

const fetchNotes = async () => {
  const response = await axios("/api/notes", config);
  return response.data;
};

const useNotes = () => {
  const { isLoading, error, data } = useQuery("notes", fetchNotes, {
    retry: false,
  });
  return { isLoading, error, data };
};

export default useNotes;
```

## Conclusion

In this article we saw how to implement the BFF architecture to secure a react app. The Duende BFF middleware makes it
easy to implement the BFF architecture. But, there is a fair amount of complexity under the hood and I wanted to delve
into some of these complexities so it doesn't seem like all magic and it also helps to know what is going on under the hood
when one has to debug issues.
