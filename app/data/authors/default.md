Hi, I'm Sangeet, Principal Software developer at a healthcare accreditation organization based in Washington DC.

This is where I hope to share my learnings about all things software development, over the years I have worked on a whole host of client side and server side technologies.

This site has been constructed from [tailwind-remix-run-mdxjs-typescript-starter-blog](https://github.com/SangeetAgarwal/tailwind-remix-run-mdxjs-typescript-starter-blog) which I also wrote.
